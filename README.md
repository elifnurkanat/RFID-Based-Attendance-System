# RFID-Based-Attendance-System

RFID, also known as Radio Frequency Identification, is a technology that mainly serves to 
identify identities and informations of objects by using radio frequency. Today, RFID 
technologies are widely used in many fields, mainly supply chains, education, safety, health, 
etc..

Attendance system with RFID technology basically consists of two parts; the first is the part 
where RFID technology is included and automatic identity recognition systems are described. 
Here, biometric recognition systems and barcodes, where RFID is most often compared, are 
also included. The second and main part; starting from the history of RFID technologies, an 
countiuning with the main characteristics, components and working principle. After that, it 
was mentioned how this system can be used as an attendance system, materials, algorithms, 
circuit diagram and software sub-base were shown.

In this study, an attendance system was developed using the Arduino Uno card and RFID 
technology. This system, which can distinguish between registered and unregistered cards in 
the course, which gives a warning if the card is read again after reading it once, was created to 
minimize the loss of time experienced in the course attendance control.
