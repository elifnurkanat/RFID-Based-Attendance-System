# RFID-Based-Attendance-System
In this study, an attendance system was developed using the Arduino Uno card and RFID  technology. This system, which can distinguish between registered and unregistered cards in  the course, which gives a warning if the card is read again after reading it once, was created to  minimize the loss of time experienced in the course attendance control.
